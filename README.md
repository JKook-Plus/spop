Split a Piece Of Paper (SPOP)
</h1>

A [website](https://spop.jkook.plus/) that splits PDF documents into multiple files.
Useful when trying to limit the amount of scanning jobs that are required.

## Features

- Runs the computation client side and does not require uploading the document to an external server
- Ability to change the amount of pages per document
- It works :)
